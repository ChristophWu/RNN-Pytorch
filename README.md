# RNN-Pytorch

## Introduction
In this project, I will implement a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for character level language model using the complete works
of William Shakespeare. 

## Dataset
- This dataset contains the plays and poetry written by English poet and actor William Shakespeare (1564-1616).
The plays are divided into the genres of tragedy, history, and comedy.
- For more details, please refer to the URL http://shakespeare.mit.edu/works.html. 

## Result
- learing curve
